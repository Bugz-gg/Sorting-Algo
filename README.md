# Sorting-Algo

This project is developed using Qt and C++. It serves as a small application to visualize and understand different sorting algorithms.

## How to Use the Project

### Windows and Linux

You have two options to use this project:

1. **Download the Release Executable**:
   - Download the latest release executable for your platform (Windows or Linux).
   - All necessary libraries are included to run the application.

2. **Clone and Build the Project Yourself**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/Bugz-gg/Sorting-Algo.git
     cd Sorting-Algo
     ```
   - Ensure you have `qmake` and `make` installed on your system.
   - Build the project:
     ```sh
     qmake -r .
     make
     ```

## Algorithms Currently Implemented

The following sorting algorithms are currently implemented:

- Bubble Sort
- BogoSort
- GnomeSort

I plan to implement at least 10 sorting algorithms. Feel free to extend the project with additional algorithms as per your convenience.

## Features

- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Each step of the sorting process is controlled, allowing you to see the algorithm in action.
- **Speed Control**: A speed slider enables you to adjust the execution speed to your preference.
- **Comparison Count**: The number of comparisons made by the algorithm is displayed.
- **Algorithm Complexity**: The time complexity of each algorithm is provided.

## Incoming Features

- **Sound Effects**: Sound will be played for each comparison, enhancing the visualization experience.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome ! You can fork it and extend it as you want and feel free to ask question.
